# TodoList_with_react_and_parse
Created with CodeSandbox

## Project description
The project is a personal schedule website that provide both personal view and guest view. The main purpose of this website is to let the website owner (Host) keep track of their todo items, while other people (Guest) can see when the host is occupied. Both views are based on their local time, so a conversion is automatically intergraded.

The project was first build as a page in my personal website. I would like my collaborators/friends know when I am available, so that they can make appointment. To that end, I can grant these friends to register a user account. Unlike admin account owned by me (the host), user account can only make appointment, and can only modify appointment object created by themselves. The host can always modify all todo items created by himself, or appointment items created by other users.

## User guide
Upon logging in on a new computer, the page will directly go to "Guest view
